DFS(Depth first Search) :-
~ It plays an important role in our project as it helps in exploring and analyzing routes in a Traffic Management System. 
~ It helps in detecting possible routes, finding connectivity, and managing congestion by traversing through all intersections (nodes).
-> Core Idea of our Algorithm:
" Starts from a source node (intersection) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. "
-> Let's understand with an example:

A --- B --- C
|     |     
D --- E --- F

If we start from node A, DFS will first go deep into connected routes before coming back to check other possible paths.
-> Data Structures Used:-
1. Graphs for representing intersections (nodes) and roads (edges)
2. Stack (can be implemented using recursion or manually) for backtracking
3. Visited Set/List for keeping track of explored intersections

-> Pseudocode:

First we will:-
1. Visit a node.
2. Mark it as visited.
3. Explore each unvisited neighbor.
4. When all neighbors are visited, backtrack to the previous node.
5. Continue until all reachable nodes are visited.

DFS(G, v) {
    visited[v] = 1;
    for all w adjacent to v {
        if (!visited[w]) {
            DFS(G, w);
        }
    }
}

-> Advantages of using this Algorithm:

1. Detects all possible routes in a city road network.
2. Helps in finding alternate paths during congestion.
3. Useful in traffic signal synchronization.
4. Helps in detecting cycles or closed loops in road networks

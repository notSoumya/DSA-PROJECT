DFS(Depth first Search) pseudo code:-
First we will:-
1.Visit a node.
2.Mark it as visited.
3.Explore each unvisited neighbor.
4.When all neighbors are visited, backtrack to the previous node.
5.Continue until all reachable nodes are visited.

DFS(G, v) {
    visited[v] = 1;
    for all w adjacent to v {
        if (!visited[w]) {
            DFS(G, w);
        }
    }
}

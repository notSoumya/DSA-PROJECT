Breadth First Search(BFS) pseudo code

BFS(Graph, start_node):
   create an empty queue Q
    mark all nodes as unvisited
    mark start_node as visited
    enqueue(start_node) into Q

    while Q is not empty:
        current_node = dequeue(Q)
        print current_node

        for each neighbor in adjacency_list[current_node]:
            if neighbor is not visited:
                mark neighbor as visited
                enqueue(neighbor)

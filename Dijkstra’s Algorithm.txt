Dijkstra’s Algorithm:

It acts as the heart of our project as it helps in finding the shortest path in Maps(Google Maps) and also in network optimization.

Core Idea of our Algorithm:

" Repeatedly picks the closest unvisited node and updates distances to its neighbors. "

Let's understand with an example:

       A --1-- B --2-- C
       |       |
       4       3
       |       |
       D --3-- E

If we want to find the shortest path based from A to C ,we have two ways but thanks to this algorithm we will get the path that has least weight.

Data Structures Used:

Graphs for storing neighbours and weights
Distance Table(can be Adjacency List) for calculating the shortest distance
Min-heap for picking the smallest distance node

Pseudocode : 
void Graph::Dijkstra(int start) {
    vector<int> dist(V, INT_MAX); 
    dist[start] = 0;

    // Min-heap: (distance, node)
    priority_queue<pair<int,int>, vector<pair<int,int>>, greater<pair<int,int>>> pq;
    pq.push({0, start});

    while(!pq.empty()) {
        int u = pq.top().second;
        int d = pq.top().first;
        pq.pop();

        // Skip if we already found a better distance
        if(d > dist[u]) continue;

        // Traverse neighbors
        for(auto [v, w] : adj[u]) {
            if(dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                pq.push({dist[v], v});
            }
        }
    }

    cout << "Shortest distances from node " << start << ":\n";
    for(int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        cout << "Node " << i << ": " << dist[i] << "\n";
}


Time Complexity: O(V^2)
Space Complexity: O(V+E)
